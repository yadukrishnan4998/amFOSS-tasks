This was an easy task because the only skill required to crack this task was some familiarity with basic terminal commands and github loging in. I didn't have any issue with this task until I tried to connect my GitHub account to my Ubuntu desktop. The 'gh auth login' command showed an error like: 'command auth not found'. That made me frusturated. I googled a lot but I couldn't get a satisfying solution. So I reached out to the amFOSS members, [@Manoj](https://amfoss.in/@Manoj/) and [@yash](https://amfoss.in/@yash/) who helped me get to the solution, therefore starring the amFOSS repositories and completing task-02.
