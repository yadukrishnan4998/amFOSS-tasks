I programmed each of the questions that I attempted using Java and each of them worked for selected test cases. Each of them failed in selected test cases due to run-time errors, timeout etc. I did the first three questions of the task. I did not define functions in order to execute bits of the program to make it easier instead I did all the program using nested loops. I defined arrays to read multiple test cases. While taking each test case to execute in the program, I defined a second loop inside the first one to execute the main task (for example: finding whether a number within the test case is a palindrome number or not). I stored each answer belonging to the corresponding test case in the same order in a different array.
