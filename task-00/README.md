# Install Ubuntu

Installing Ubuntu was very easy, since I had help from my father who is a System Administrator and a Linux Mint enthusiast. 
I didn't face any issue while installing Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. I partitioned about 100GB for ubuntu and the rest for Windows.
I alloted around 16GB as virtual RAM. I have an HP 14s laptop with 12th Generation Intel Core i5, Iris X Graphics with 16GB RAM and 512GB storage. I didn't face any issue while booting Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. I'm thinking of switching to Linux Mint Cinnamon.
