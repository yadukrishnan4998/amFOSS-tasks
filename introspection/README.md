Why must we chose you?

I am very pationate about open-source even though I am very new to all of this. Learning coding was one of the things that made me really interested in developing useful software. From the amFOSS 30-day workshop I saw a lot of interesting things and a glimpse of what open-source is and how it works. I am very interested in learning different techniques and deploying it into mini projects which then can become 

What is your plan for the next 6 months?

My plan for the next 6 months is to learn Python and stick to it, along with learning bits of other languages like C/C++ etc. I have now understood that it's about time to leave Java since it's ageing. After establishing some good knowledge in Python, I want to continue developing projects based on the things that I've learned so far. I haven't really decided what to work on. I also want to establish my Github account and try to contribute a lot to the open source community by checking out 



How would you contribute back to the club?

I want to contribute to amFOSS projects that interests me and I know that there are going to be a lot. By contributing I mean correcting errors and adding new elements to projects and just making it better aesthetically and functionally. 




Do you have any feedback on the selection process?

I don't see anything wrong with the selection process. But I genuinely do think that this is one of the best recruitment processes that I've heard of. This selection process is just the perfect way to select a person who is determined to do task, contribute to open-source and someone who is good at efficient learning.
