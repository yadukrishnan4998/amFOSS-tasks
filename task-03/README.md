I attempted two questions in this task. One being Hero To Zero and the other being Shrink To Win. I completed the latter. I used Python 3 to solve this question. It was the easiest question among the Hackerrank question in this task. I didn't complete the rest since it took a lot of my time. And since I didn't have much knowledge in Python, I tried to do most of the questions in Java 08. And that was quiet hard for me since I almost forgot how to program in Java. But I did my best and used arrays to solve these questions. ShrinkToWin was pretty simple since it only required to make a code that could return the count of operations done in finding the sume of digits of a number till that number becomes single digit.
