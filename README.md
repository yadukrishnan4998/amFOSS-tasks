# About Me

- üëã Hey, I am Yadukrishnan P, I am from Malakkara, a village near Aranmula in the district of Pathanamthitta, Kerala. I am a fresher at Amrita School of Engineering, Amritapuri Campus. I am from the ECE batch of 2022. I am completely new to coding in GitHub but it's always been something that I wanted to discover. In school, I learned programming in Java till 12th grade. Now I am learning some basics of Python like arithmetic operators, data types etc. I have always been interested in learning coding, solving challenging and interesting questions. I found a new hobby in learning new programming languages. 
As I said, I am currently learning Python which I started learning after my entrance exams. I have already set my eyes on learning other languages as well. My biggest inspiration for taking Amrita is amFOSS. I came to know about amFOSS when my interest in GSoC was at its peak. I was very interested in coding competitions like GSoC even though it's not a competition. I was browsing through Quora in order to know more about GSoC and so I did the obvious and searched which all colleges contributed students to the program. I saw Amrita School Of Engineering, Amritapuri Campus. I dug deeper as to why it was only Amritapuri campus and that's how I came to know about amFOSS. 

- üëÄ Apart from coding and learning programming I‚Äôm also interested in music theory, football and cricket.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning programming in Python. I want to learn coding in GitHub. I am also interested in machine learning and tensorflow which are the biggest reasons as to why I chose Python to learn. I am also interested in learning programming in LiSP 

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on projects at amFOSS.
